# AI Project Structure

This AI project is structured for optimal development and deployment of AI models. Below is an overview of its directory structure:

- `/src` - Contains the source code of the AI models, including algorithms, data preprocessing, and utility functions.
- `/data` - Contains datasets, data samples, and any data-related scripts. This directory is essential for training and testing the models.
- `/models` - Stores the trained models and their respective versions. This directory is crucial for model management and versioning.
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and testing. A space for experimentation and visualization.
- `/docs` - Documentation of the project, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and model specifications.
- `/tests` - Contains test cases and testing scripts to ensure the models and code are functioning as expected.
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts for tasks such as data fetching, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- `/config` - Configuration files for the project, including settings for model training, deployment, and other utilities.

Each directory serves a specific purpose, ensuring a structured and organized approach to AI project development. This structure promotes best practices in software development and data science, facilitating collaboration, and enhancing the project's scalability and maintainability.
